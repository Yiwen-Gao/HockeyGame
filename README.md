# HockeyGame
Use the up and down arrow keys to move the hockey stick and block the puck from your goal.
If the player is successful in blocking the puck, it'll rebound and hit one of the side walls.
If not and the puck enters the goal, the game ends. The scoreboard will count the number of 
successful blocks the player has made. Happy playing!
